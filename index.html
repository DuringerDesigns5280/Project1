          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi! My name is Taylor I am originally from a small town of 1,000 people in southwest Utah. I moved to Denver 6 years ago to live “that big city life”. I have loved every minute of living in this vibrant city. The picture is of me and my boyfriend
            Brandon we just bought our first home this past June! Since buying the house I have found an interest in gardening and landscape design. We also have our dog Louis who is 10 years old aka fat and lazy! In our free time we enjoy going to the
            Denver Center of Performing Arts where we are yearly subscribers. Also love cooking, baking, and entertaining. </p>

          <h1>Before Galvanize</h1>
          <p> Before I started this new journey of becoming a Web Developer I spent that past 10 years working in healthcare. I found myself always wanting solutions to our slow/terrible UX software and equipment. This is what made me want to go into software
            development. I want to ease the work flow of Dr’s, nurses, techs, and other providers. Working with people in their worst days is a very humbling experience and makes you feel like you are impacting people’s lives. During some of the most
            critical times in the hospital you have equipment not working or having to leave the bed side to chart. I hope to change the future of how healthcare providers use the technology at the bedside. </p>
