        <p>1. Learn more Css to finish and submit website 1.1. Today I started with the goal to finish the first of the 3 simple sites. I set the intention of working with more flex to finish this assignment. I actually ended up working through the first
          and blowing through the second section very quickly. It was very helpful to work alongside one of my classmates. I find that I work well in a team setting to run ideas through and trouble shooting together.</p>
          <p>2. Complete one of the blog posts.
          I am not going to lie I was very confused on what the "visual" aspect of this was. So I reached out on slack and got some help. I made the blog post into an html/css so I can easily add it to my end of section 1 project. It was very helpful
          to actually utilize the steps of "setting the stage", very helpful.</p>

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>1- To complete my final website. I completed the last website project using Flexbox attending the breakout helped me so much! Setting these goal are helping me a lot as I am the type of person who needs deadlines so this helps. I am feeling so
          much more confident with css. I also did my learn blog on this assignment and using Flexbox.</p> <p> 2- Attend a breakout. I attended the Css break out with Brooks and it was AWESOME! So helpful and helped me complete my first goal as well So that was
          very helpful. My goal for tomorrow is to attend two breakouts and a meet-up. These are so helpful and really make a huge difference in my learning.</p> <p> 3- Learn Firebase I was kind of nervous about this... So I "set the stage" found a quiet spot
          and started using it. I watched a few youtube videos and that helped a lot! I am going to keep using this so I don't forget how to "init" & "deploy" my sites. Setting goals have helped me with staying on track everyday and a great way to 'track'
          my progress everyday. The days that I don't set up goals I find myself not working methodically and more distracted. So I have now started doing goals every morning before I start the day. The one thing I will do differently each day is making
          sure that I making attainable goals and allowing myself enough time to complete them all.</p>

      <div class="goal">
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>1) Watch Javascript for beginner Video-- Today I watched Matts intro to Js and it was a life saver! Helped me get over my block with JS and I learned a ton! I went down to Brider had some coffee and watched the video as well as took a lot of
        notes. I am ready to do some more JS tomorrow.</p> <p>2) start java lesson 1-- I did not accomplish this goal as I ran out of time. I think I maybe set up too many goals that took more time than I expected. This goal will roll over to tomorrow and I
        will get it started tomorrow!</p> <p> 3) Fix website 3 (Done)-- I got my 3rd website sent back due to my html not being valid. I used the W3c tool to fix the issues. Why I did not do this in the first place is beyond me. I will use this tool from now
        on! S0 helpful.</p> <p> 4) Complete a Learn-to-Learn-- I wrote a learn to learn blog on my first goal of watching the intro to JS. It was very helpful and my first goal helped me complete my 4th goal! I am glad I tied these two goals together so I had
        to watch the video and start learning JS.</p> <p> 5)Attend a Breakout on something I don't know anything about.-- Even though I did not know everything that was going on. This break out was a lot of fun to get out of my comfort zone and not be afraid
        to learn something new. We learned about front end, MVC, and how to build an app with React. It was a great intro and also so nice to see how helpful bootstrap is!</p> <p> The goal setting today helped me with finally facing my fear of JS. I made it a
        goal first thing this morning and I accomplished it because it was my main goal. I have gotten into the habit of writing down my goals in the morning. T0his has helped me with building a little structure for my day. I personally do really well
        with structure and deadlines, goal setting really helps me accomplish the things I need to get done everyday. I finished all but one of my goals, I think I set to many big goals for the day so as the day came to and end I had not started the JavaScript
        lesson 1. I feel ok that I did not finish everything because now I already have a goal ready for tomorrow! It also has helped me reflect on what I did complete today! Like getting out of my comfort zone to attend a break out on front-end frameworks..
        which I know nothing about I was surprised that I actually was able to follow along with most of the lecture and that I learned something new. Goal setting is something that I will continue to utilize outside of gSchool and in the workforce.</p>
