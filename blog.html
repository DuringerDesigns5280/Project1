        <h1>Learning Git & Github</h1>
        <p>Learning Git & Github During my 'Pre-course' work I really struggled a lot with using git & Github to submit my work. Come to find out I was doing it completely wrong. I started class with a very bad experience with Git & Github. Come day 2 of
          class I sat down and 'cleared' the stage. I included a video of how I did this. 1st I exit out of all my distractions as well as shut off notifications for my study time. I like to turn music on while I am learning something to drowned out the
          surrounding noises. Then I started playing with Git & Github using my command line. I had to make a small sticky-note for my laptop that says the order of: 1- git add . 2- git commit -m"msg" 3- git push I did this because I kept messing up the
          order of how to push to my repositories. This has helped me tromendosuly, visual aides are my jam. During our 'Git-Pull-Assessments' Was when I really started learning how to utilize these skills and the repetition helped. I plan to continue
          to learn and get more comfortable with Git & Github. As this was just scratching the surface, but after dedicating time to learn how to push to my repositories through the command line I can better keep track of my changes. This lesson on learning
          to learn has helped me a lot to setting and clearing the stage to set me up for sucess.</p>

        <h1>Learning Flexbox</h1>
        <p>This post is going to be my learning experience with Css using flexbox. To start off I like to "set the stage" by closing out of any of my distraction (i.e Facebook, iMessage, Email, etc.) turning on some good music to help me stay focused, finally
          I find a quiet spot to work. I had an ok grasp using Css during my pre course work, I watched a lot of youtube videos! One of the biggest helps in learning Flexbox was the Css tricks website with the diagram photos of what each function actually
          does. Making a "Css play" file was a lot of fun and very helpful to actually write the code out and see the out come. Today Brooks and Marlena taught a great break out on Flexbox! I learned how utilize the developer tools and how much time this
          tool can save you! My reflection is that using these tools I feel like I am actually grasping these topics! These tools will be something I will use throughout my career as a developer.</p>

        <h1>Learning Intro to JS</h1>
        <p>Today I learned intro to JavaScript by watching the 'Intro to JS' By Matt. I have had this very weird block with JS and have been so terrified to learn it... Or even if I could learn in it. So today I stepped away from the classroom and went to
          Brider, order some grub, and then I set the stage on my compute. I start by closing my distractions and got to work...Well got to listening. With this subject specifically I took a lot of notes to be able to refer back to and study. This truly
          helped me get over this block/fear of JS I only learned the basics but these means tomorrow I will be able to start learning a little bit more and chipping away at those JS modules. My play with this topic was writing notes and practicing some
          code in the dev tools browser. Writing notes really helped my retain the information hearing it, seeing it, and writing it! Works like a charm for me. I feel confident in knowing the 5 primitive data types (Number. Strings, Booleans, Nulls,
          and Undefined), operators, operands, and variables. Watching this Video helped me so much! The Js breakout I went to was more advanced than I needed, I am glad we have the videos as extra resources.</p>
