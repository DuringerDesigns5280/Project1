          <h1>Devs Happy Hour </h1>
          <p>I attended the Devs happy hour 3.13<br> The First person I met was named Scott he works with Go Code Colorado. It is an awesome company that utilizes state information to have competitions to build apps for the public.<br> One of the other people
            I spoke with was named Josh. He is an independent front end developer who just moved to Denver from Fort Collins. He was very interested in Galvanize workspace so I got him in touch with an instructor for more information. His most recent
            project was an app that tracks the more pollute areas of Fort Collins. We talked a lot about Sass as I am just starting to learn/play around with it. He actually gave me his number so we can meet for beers and code. I learned a lot about how
            diverse the community is and how many different places you can work. It was great chatting with people who are working with the front end, back end, and also a developer who works in aerospace. I am excited to attend more of these happy hours!

          <h1>Healthcare Tech</h1>
          <p>Healthcare Tech meet up on 3.21<br> I actually ran into Lenny who is an It architect at Uchealth the hospital I previously worked at before Gschool. We had actually collaborated on a project I worked on for the burn center. It was great to reconnect
            with him and chat about school and where I want to take my healthcare experience and utilize it with the tech industry. We chatted a lot about the growth and changes happening within the uchealth System and he told me they have some developer
            jobs open and opening in the future.So this is very excited to hear! I Chatted briefly with another developer (Kyle) who is working with centura health to develop a dictation software for doctors and providers. There are a lot of barriers
            within in this type of software due to HIPPA (patient privacy) and using a voice to text software. It was interesting to hear they are problem solving though this and may have to actually work with more of the legality of HIPPA. I learned
            that my past skill set and network of healthcare is definitely transferable and is going to help me tremendously get a job as a developer in healthcare. I am looking forward to do more research on the legality of some softwares in healthcare.

          <h1>Networking</h1>
          <p>The future of Patient engagement.<br> I spoke with Alanna first, who is an account exec for Medix. Which is a workforce solutions company who is also working to develop more user friendly patient tech for clinics. She was a great person to chat
            with about what they are working on and where the company is heading. She was super nice! I spoke with this guy named Brandon who was in charge of an Ehealth division for centura Health. This is something I am very interested in as I did a
            lot of Ehealth work at the University Hospital. I learned a lot about patient engagement and how this is hopefully going to help with better outcomes with getting patients more engaged with their health..... This has actually sparked an idea
            for an APP... Maybe a capstone...</p>
